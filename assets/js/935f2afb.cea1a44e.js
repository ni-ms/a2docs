We\'ve crafted a complex model of Block-C by joining simple shapes of cubes and ellipsoids. We\'ve also used various features of OpenGL to manipulate the 3D model, such as moving, zooming and scaling it. Also textures and lighting effects have been added to make the model look more realistic.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"method":{"id":"method","title":"Methodology","description":"Designing the 3D model of a scene from the story board started with choosing a scene which was fairly complex for implementation and also feasible to build.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"opengl":{"id":"opengl","title":"OpenGL Instantiation","description":"Commands","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
